## Setup local development environment
At the current stage this site requires a webserver that processes php.
There are many ways of setting up one but the simplest and cross platform would be to install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and `clone` this repository to the `htdocs` folder.

Start XAMPP and look for run `apache` on the user interface. Provided that `phpnotes` is in your `htdocs` folder, type [`localhost/phpnotes`](http://localhost/phpnotes/index.php) on a browser of your choice and the site should load up.
